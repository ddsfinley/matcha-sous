# Matcha Sous — site

Static, no framework. Bone & aubergine identity: bright warm ground, the
wordmark's deep aubergine carrying type, buttons and feature bands, copper
only at small scale. Cormorant Garamond (display) + Jost (utility). Lives in
`/site`; the legacy storefront at the repo root is untouched.

## Pages
- `index.html` — single scrolling product page: hero → why → gallery (figures)
  → by-hand-vs-Matcha Sous comparison → method → **order area** → engraved spec plate → Q&A
- `how-to-use.html` — the full method: weigh, sift, fill, whisk, build (ice/milk), sweeten + care (HowTo schema)
- `journal/` — SEO article hub + 4 posts (Article schema)
- `about.html` — Our story (founder narrative, values, craft — the sous chef framing)
- `faq.html` — FAQ & support (native `<details>`, zero JS) + matching FAQPage JSON-LD
- `wholesale.html` — hospitality pitch + enquiry form (composes a mailto; no backend)
- `proposals/` — Stage-1 design directions (kept for the record, noindex)

## Brand

**The mark** is the stacked wordmark — MATCHA in tracked caps over SOUS in a
custom display face whose letterforms carry vortex slashes (the whisk's
motion, cut into the type). The slashed **O** doubles as the standalone
glyph: favicon, touch icon, stamps. A soft circle-glow arc is the secondary
motif (CTA band, OG card).

**Files**:
- `assets/img/wordmark.png` — keyed transparent bone lockup (266×94, ~2×
  header display size). Cut from the supplied art; **raster** — request the
  master vector file from the logo's designer before any print use.
- `favicon.svg` — slashed-O glyph on an ink tile
- `apple-touch-icon.png` — 180×180 ink tile + O
- `assets/img/logo-512.png` — square lockup for Organization structured data
- `assets/img/og.jpg` — 1200×630 social card (wordmark + glow arc + tagline)

**Palette** (bright ground, aubergine anchor, copper hints):
page `#F7F4EE` / paper `#FDFBF7` / warm alt `#F0EBE2`,
aubergine `#1A1322` — the logo background, **exact** — / deep `#140E1B`
(buttons, footer, announce, CTA band, compare column, `.bg-deep`, numerals,
feature icons), body text `#251D30`,
bone `#EDE4D8` (type on aubergine surfaces),
copper `#B0714F` / deep `#96593A` / soft `#D9B49E` — **small scale only**
(eyebrows, links, heading italics, plate numbers, rules, markers),
stone `#6F6862` (warm-grey secondary text — deliberately no violet cast),
mat `#EFE9DF` (photo frames). No pastel purples anywhere: purple exists
only as the deep aubergine.

**Usage rules**
1. The ground stays bright; aubergine appears as confident anchors — the
   cinematic hero, the mood band, the announce bar, buttons, the "Matcha Sous" compare column, the founder band
   (`.bg-deep`), the CTA band and the footer. Body text itself is
   aubergine-tinted, never plain black — that is the only purple on light
   ground; never tint surfaces lavender or lilac.
2. Copper is a seasoning, not a color field: eyebrows, text links, the Q&A
   "+", thin rules, the live dot, focus rings, the compare ribbon. Never
   fill a large surface or a primary button with copper.
3. The header uses `wordmark-ink.png` on light ground; the footer keeps the
   bone `wordmark.png` on aubergine. Favicon/touch icon stay ink-tiled (the
   logo's native staging).
4. Photography mounts in warm mats (`--mat`); never borderless on lilac.

**Voice** (per the packaging design brief): the story is **quiet expertise
and consistency, never time-saving**. The product is a sous — it handles the
technical work so the bowl, the pour and the moment stay the user's. Category
line: **"The Original Hands-Free Matcha Mixer"** (product title, page titles,
Product schema). Working copy: "Controlled vortex motion mixes matcha and
water with consistent, hands-free precision. Start the cycle and let your
sous handle the rest." Never frame the chasen as the slow alternative — the
sous works beside the tradition. Positioning vs hand whisking: **we respect
it and do not compete with it** — the Sous is an alternative for volume,
"for the days that pour more matcha than hand whisking can keep up with."
Comparisons read as two tools/one craft: same check marker in both columns,
no scoring visuals, no "easier" badges. Avoid: matcha-leaf/bamboo/whisk/bowl
graphics, vortex symbols, MS monograms, badges, promo language, spec-heavy
front sections. Speed figures (~30 s) are facts for spec contexts only. **Wording rule:
whisking is ceremony — zen and calm for the matcha community — never
"labor," "effort," "chore," "guesswork," "wrist work," or anything that
frames the practice as a burden. The Sous is framed around convenience and
on-the-go moments ("for mornings that move quickly"), never as rescue from
the whisk.** House line for the dark mood band: **"The ceremony,
preserved. The Sous, in service of it."** — ceremony first, the Sous
second and subordinate; also a candidate for the box interior.

**Tagline hierarchy** (one voice, three jobs):
1. **"Behind every great matcha is a Sous."** — the primary line (the hero
   headline itself, footer, OG card, Organization `slogan`). Capital S: *a Sous* is
   the product as a noun, echoing "behind every great chef is a sous." The
   full sentence should sit near the wordmark, which closes the analogy.
2. **"Behind every great matcha."** — the short/stamp form, as printed on
   the box; use standalone where space is tight.
3. **"The sous chef for matcha"** — the descriptor, used inside sentences
   ("Meet the sous chef for matcha"). "Crafted in ceremony" stays reserved
   for packaging stamps only.

## Launch checklist
0. **Shopify port (deferred)**: once this design is declared final, reskin
   `shopify-theme/` to match it (palette, wordmark, copy, $150) and rebuild
   the zip — the theme currently wears the retired forest/gold identity.
1. **Checkout**: replace `https://checkout.matchasous.com/matcha-sous` (marked `TODO`)
   in `index.html` with the real hosted checkout URL.
1b. **Price**: the site sells at $150; the packaging brief anticipates
   $179–199 retail. Reconcile before launch (price appears in buy box, nav,
   CTAs, Product schema and meta description).
1c. **Lifestyle photography**: `assets/img/mood-counter.webp` (the light mood
   band, "The counter is the new café.") is a placeholder — a regraded product
   shot. Replace with a real home-counter scene at 1400×786 WebP and revisit the
   line at the same time. The dark band's `mood-ritual.webp` is also a regrade.
1d. **Claim verification**: contactless magnetic drive — **confirmed by the
   founder**. Still unconfirmed: "backlit" controls (removed from about.html;
   check before reintroducing). Box-verified facts: 18 speed
   levels, 3 preset programs, 40–120 ml capacity, hands-free preparation,
   easy-clean design, 6 W low power; included: mixer base, matcha cup,
   power adapter, USB-C cable, user manual; marks FCC, CE, RoHS.
2. Deploy `/site` contents at the **domain root** of matchasous.com — canonicals,
   OG URLs, `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` already point there.
3. Submit `sitemap.xml` in Google Search Console.
4. Emails `care@` / `wholesale@matchasous.com` must exist (or edit them).
